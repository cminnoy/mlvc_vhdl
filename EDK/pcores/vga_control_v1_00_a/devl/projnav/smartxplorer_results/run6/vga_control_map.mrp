Interim Summary
---------------
Logic Utilization:
  Total Number Slice Registers:       1,335 out of  11,776   11%
    Number used as Flip Flops:          864
    Number used as Latches:             471
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             1,466 out of  11,776   12%
Logic Distribution:
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   1,783 out of   1,783 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   1,783   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       1,748 out of  11,776   14%
    Number used as logic:             1,466
    Number used as a route-thru:        282

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                445 out of     372  119% (OVERMAPPED)
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     4 out of      24   16%
  Number of MULT18X18SIOs:                6 out of      20   30%


Design Summary
--------------
Number of errors   :   2
Number of warnings :   2

Section 1 - Errors
------------------
ERROR:Pack:2309 - Too many bonded comps of type "IOB" found to fit this device.
ERROR:Map:237 - The design is too large to fit the device.  Please check the
   Design Summary section to see which resource requirement for your design
   exceeds the resources available in the device. Note that the number of slices
   reported may not be reflected accurately as their packing might not have been
   completed.

   NOTE:  An NCD file will still be generated to allow you to examine the mapped
   design.  This file is intended for evaluation use only, and will not process
   successfully through PAR.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:Security:42 - Your license support version '2010.04' for WebPack expires
in 25 days after which you will not qualify for Xilinx software updates or new
releases.
WARNING:LIT:243 - Logical network VFBC1_Wd_Almost_Full has no load.
WARNING:LIT:395 - The above warning message is repeated 175 more times for the
   following (max. 5 shown):
   VFBC1_Cmd_Almost_Full,
   PLB_wrPrim,
   VFBC0_Rd_Almost_Empty,
   VFBC0_Rd_Empty,
   PLB_rdBurst
   To see the details of these warning messages, please use the -detail switch.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:Security:54 - 'xc3s700an' is a WebPack part.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
INFO:Pack:1716 - Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range:
   0.000 to 85.000 Celsius)
INFO:Pack:1720 - Initializing voltage to 1.140 Volts. (default - Range: 1.140 to
   1.260 Volts)
