ERROR:Pack:2309 - Too many bonded comps of type "IOB" found to fit this device.
ERROR:Map:237 - The design is too large to fit the device.  Please check the
   Design Summary section to see which resource requirement for your design
   exceeds the resources available in the device. Note that the number of slices
   reported may not be reflected accurately as their packing might not have been
   completed.

   NOTE:  An NCD file will still be generated to allow you to examine the mapped
   design.  This file is intended for evaluation use only, and will not process
   successfully through PAR.

Interim Summary
---------------
Logic Utilization:
  Total Number Slice Registers:       1,170 out of  11,776    9%
    Number used as Flip Flops:          699
    Number used as Latches:             471
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             1,466 out of  11,776   12%
Logic Distribution:
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   1,697 out of   1,697 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   1,697   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       1,748 out of  11,776   14%
    Number used as logic:             1,466
    Number used as a route-thru:        282

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                445 out of     372  119% (OVERMAPPED)
    IOB Flip Flops:                     165
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     4 out of      24   16%
  Number of MULT18X18SIOs:                6 out of      20   30%


Mapping completed.
