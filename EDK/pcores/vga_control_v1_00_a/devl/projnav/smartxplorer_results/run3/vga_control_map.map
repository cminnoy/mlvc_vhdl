WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   USER_LOGIC_I/viewport0_sy_end_not0001 is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This
   is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data
   into the flip-flop.
ERROR:Pack:2309 - Too many bonded comps of type "IOB" found to fit this device.
ERROR:Pack:18 - The design is too large for the given device and package. 
   Please check the Design Summary section to see which resource requirement for
   your design exceeds the resources available in the device.

   NOTE: An NCD file will still be generated to allow you to examine the mapped
   design.  This file is intended for evaluation use only, and will not process
   successfully through PAR.

   This mapped NCD file can be used to evaluate how the design's logic has been
   mapped into FPGA logic resources.  It can also be used to analyze
   preliminary, logic-level (pre-route) timing with one of the Xilinx static
   timing analysis tools (TRCE or Timing Analyzer).

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      2
Number of warnings:    3
Logic Utilization:
  Total Number Slice Registers:       1,335 out of  11,776   11%
    Number used as Flip Flops:          864
    Number used as Latches:             471
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             1,466 out of  11,776   12%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          1,336 out of   5,888   22%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   1,336 out of   1,336 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   1,336   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       1,748 out of  11,776   14%
    Number used as logic:             1,466
    Number used as a route-thru:        282

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                445 out of     372  119% (OVERMAPPED)
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     4 out of      24   16%
  Number of MULT18X18SIOs:                6 out of      20   30%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                2.46

Peak Memory Usage:  201 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  11 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   7 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.
